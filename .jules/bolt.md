**Learning:** Using `pow(x, c)` for small constant integer exponents in pixel-evaluated fragment shaders can be highly unoptimized depending on the graphics API.
**Action:** Always rewrite integer-based exponentiation as explicit variable multiplications. For example, use `x * x * x` instead of `pow(x, 3.0)` to save ALU cycles and improve GPU fragment processing times.
## 2024-05-24 - Expensive Scene Traversal in Initialization Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` causes O(N) scene hierarchy traversals, which becomes a severe bottleneck when called repeatedly inside initialization loops (e.g., `SceneDirector.SetupScene` iterating over character profiles and interactive objects).
**Action:** Always use a dictionary cache (`Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references during scene initialization sequences, ensuring to check `obj != null` on retrieval to handle natively destroyed objects correctly.
## 2024-05-24 - Expensive GameObject.Find in Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` is an O(N) operation traversing the scene hierarchy and is especially expensive when called repeatedly inside loops or initialization sequences like `SceneDirector.SetupScene`.
**Action:** Always use dictionary caches (e.g., `Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references to avoid repeated scene traversals.
